## Day 1

1. **A blockchain** is a decentralised ledger that uses public key cryptography. There are different consensus mechanisms to secure a blockchain, the first was proof of work and there are many different flavours of proof of stake. Both systems employ a system of nodes to verify the state of the ledger and add new blocks (records). Most blockchains are permissionless so anyone can use them or participate in running a node. 

Blockchains were a revolutionary invention bringing together cryptogaphy and austrian economics to enable provable ownership and transfer of digital assets, which was previously not solved due to the double spend problem.

2. **A smart contract** is a code written to a blockchain that can automatically execute actions when it's predefined conditions are met.
3. - **A script** reads from a blockchain and does not cost anything.

   - **A transaction**  interacts with a blockchain and requires a transaction fee to execute

## Day 2

1. **The 5 pillars of Cadence:**
   - Safety & security 
   - Clarity 
   - Approachability
   - Developer Experience 
   - Resource Oriented
2.  All of these points are directly addressing weaknesses in Solidity.
